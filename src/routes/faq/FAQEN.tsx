<p className="MsoNormal" ><b><span >Can
I make money with RedrumPro? </span></b></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >If
you have purchased shares in a project, there are several ways you can increase
your money. <br/>
Here is an example calculation for our first project, The Basement Games.
However, please note that the conditions may vary depending on the project.
Therefore, always read the respective project description thoroughly.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >Firstly,
upon completion of the project, you will receive a guaranteed return of 7%.
Additionally, you have the option to return your shares to RedrumPro and
receive your initial investment back. In this case, you will receive: </span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your initial investment + 7%
return</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >If
you choose to keep your shares, you will remain a shareholder in the project
and potentially benefit from quarterly profit distributions of the project. The
amount of the distribution is determined by the success of the project. </span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >In
this case, you will receive: </span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a one-time 7% return on your initial investment + profit
distributions </span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >Additionally,
once the integrated secondary market is unlocked in the coming months, you can
sell your shares profitably to other producers.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><b><span >How
can I buy shares?</span></b><span > </span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >On
RedrumPro, you can purchase exclusive shares in exciting entertainment projects
and trade on the secondary market in the future. After we release a project
within the RedrumPro web app, you can view the current projects in the investor
dashboard after registering.</span></p>

<ol >
 <li className="MsoNormal" ><span lang="DE">Register or log in.</span></li>
 <li className="MsoNormal" ><span >Select
     a project in the investor dashboard and click "Secure Shares
     Now."</span></li>
 <li className="MsoNormal" ><span >Enter
     the desired number of shares and click "Continue."</span></li>
 <li className="MsoNormal" ><span >Purchase
     the shares with your preferred payment method.</span></li>
</ol>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >Secondary
Market : In the coming months, the secondary market will also be unlocked,
allowing you to purchase shares from other registered users or sell your own
shares.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><b><span >How
do I receive my shares?</span></b><span >
</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >Once
you have completed the ordering process and RedrumPro can confirm receipt of
payment, the shares will be automatically transferred to your internal
RedrumPro portfolio.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><b><span >Until
when can shares be purchased for a project?</span></b><span> </span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >As
long as the film value or investment deadline of a project has not been
reached, it is possible to purchase shares of ongoing projects at any time.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><b><span >When
and where do I receive my profit distributions?</span></b><span > </span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >When
a project generates profits, your individual amount will be automatically
transferred to your internal Redrum settlement account on a quarterly basis.
You will be informed by email and then have the option to purchase additional
shares in new projects or have the amount paid out to your preferred bank
account.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><b><span >Do
I need to pay taxes on my Redrum Pro earnings?</span></b><span > </span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >RedrumPro
points out that participation and receipt of profit distributions may have tax
consequences. However, we do not offer tax advice at RedrumPro and recommend
that you consult your personal tax advisor for any tax-related questions and
earnings.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><b><span >Does
buying or selling incur fees?</span></b><span >
</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >At
the current time, there are no service or management fees! However, Redrum Pro
reserves the right to make changes in the future.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><b><span >Is
there a minimum investment amount?</span></b><span >
</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >You
can start building your film portfolio with an investment as low as 1â‚¬.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><b><span >How
long am I involved in a project?</span></b><span >
</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >The
participation period varies from project to project. For our first project,
"The Basement Games", for example, you are involved in the project
indefinitely, or on a lifetime basis.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><b><span >What
does Redrum Film Value mean?</span></b><span >
</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >The
term "Redrum Film Value" refers to the monetary value at which Redrum
Films &amp; Entertainment GmbH is willing to sell shares of a project through
the RedrumPro web app. The Redrum Film Value is determined based on an
evaluation of the project by Redrum Films &amp; Entertainment GmbH and can vary
depending on market conditions and demand. The evaluation and resulting Redrum
Film Value of a film project are based on factors including:</span></p>

<p className="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" >-<span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span >Cultural value: The
cultural value of a film refers to its significance and influence on society
and culture. A film can be considered culturally significant if it addresses
historical events or societal issues, or establishes new cultural trends and
styles. The cultural value of a film can also be determined by awards and
recognition at festivals or other events. </span></p>

<p className="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" >-<span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span >Creative value: The
creative value of a film refers to its artistic quality and originality. A film
can be considered creatively valuable if it uses innovative cinematic
techniques or narrative structures, or creates unique visual or auditory
effects. The creative value of a film can also be determined by recognition
from film critics or other industry experts. </span></p>

<p className="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" >-<span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span >Commercial value: The
commercial value of a film refers to its ability to generate revenue and
profits. A film can be considered commercially valuable if it appeals to a
broad audience and achieves high box office results, or if it generates
additional revenue through merchandising or other marketing strategies. The
commercial value of a film can also be determined by its repeat viewings on
television, sales figures on DVD or Blu-ray, or streaming platforms. </span></p>

<p className="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" >-<span >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span >Production value: The
production value of a film project refers to the total costs required to
produce the film, including compensation for employees, equipment costs, props,
locations, script, post-production, and other related costs. It is the amount
that must be spent to produce the film from concept to final completion. The
production value can vary widely depending on the type and scope of the film.
Overall, the Redrum Film Value is a complex and multifaceted evaluation of the
value of a film that is not limited to its production costs but also considers
cultural, creative, and commercial value, among other factors.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><b><span >What
happens if the Redrum Film Value is not reached?</span></b></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >No
problem! Since Redrum Pro is involved in every project, the realization of the
projects is independent of the achievement of the Redrum Film Value.</span></p>
