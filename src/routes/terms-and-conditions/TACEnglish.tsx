<p className="MsoNormal" ><b><span >1.
Requirements for the conclusion of the contract</span></b></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >Redrum
Pro makes film projects available for investment in the app and on the website
in return for a share of the exploitation proceeds. These are own film projects
that Redrum Pro realizes as a film producer or third-party projects. The latter
are explicitly marked as such. If a third-party project is presented for
investment, the contract is concluded with the film producer named for the
project and not with Redrum Pro. Redrum Pro is not liable for the third party
producer<b>. </b></span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><b><span >&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >An
investment requires what follows:</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >1.
The investment in a film work can be closed via the Redrum Pro website or app.
The prerequisite is the registration of the producer on one of the two
applications, which then also applies to the other. The registration is free of
charge. It is allowed only to persons of legal capacity. </span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >The
information to be provided during registration must be complete and correct. If
these change after registration (e.g. change of residence), the information
must be changed immediately.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >3.
The Producer is responsible for ensuring that only he or she can use his/her account
alone. The password must be kept strictly confidential. The use of the account
with the password indexes the use by the Producer. </span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >4.
An account is not transferable. Multiple registrations are not permitted. In
the event of inheritance, any credit balance will only be paid to the person named
in the certificate of inheritance.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >5.
Redrum pro reserves the right to delete incomplete accounts as well as accounts
that have not been used for an extended period of time and for which neither
credits nor shares are verifiable.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >6.
The producer can discuss with about the offered film projects. Redrum Pro is a friendly,
objective and fair tone important. Redrum Pro therefore reserves the right to
delete contributions that violate these principles.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><b><span >2.
Investment in film projects</span></b></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><b><span >&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >1.
An investment is made when the payment processing form on the website or in the
app is filled out and the button "order with obligation to pay" is
clicked. </span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >2.
The investment must be accepted by Redrum Pro. This will be done by a
confirmation email. There will be no further correspondence. There is no right
to the implementation of the investment without the acceptance by Redrum Pro.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >3.
The possibility of investing in a film project is limited in time. The time
period is solely at the discretion of Redrum Pro. It can also be extended by Redrum
Pro. </span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >4.
Investments made may be diverted to another project without the Producers'
consent if the desired value of the film is not achieved.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><b><span >3.
payment processing</span></b></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><b><span >&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >1.
Payment processing is carried out exclusively by payment service providers with
permission to operate financial transfer business. </span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >2.
The following applies to SEPA direct debits in this context: if the Producer's
account does not have sufficient funds, the fees incurred for this may be charged
to him alone.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><b><span >&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><b><span >4.
Commissions, premiums and fees</span></b></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><b><span >&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >1)
Redrum Pro is entitled to receive a commission from the investment recipient.
This does NOT increase the Producer's contribution. </span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >2.
Producers may only offset against commissions with claims from credit notes not
yet issued and with due and/or future claims if these claims have been legally
established or are undisputed.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><b><span >&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><b><span >5.
Status of online services provided by Redrum Pro</span></b></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >1.
Redrum Pro is not obligated to provide the free services. Functions or features
may be added, supplemented, deleted or replaced. Investments made are not
affected by this.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >2.
The scope and functionalities of the App and the Website may be changed or
discontinued by Redrum Pro.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><b><span >&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><b><span >6.
Data protection </span></b></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><b><span >&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >Redrum
Pro strictly adheres to the GDPR.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >1.
As far as data are deposited with Redrum Pro or arise, Redrum Pro is entitled
to disclose them according to the legal requirements, e.g. to the tax
authorities. The Producer may object to the release of his data by the Federal
Central Tax Office. For this purpose, the Producer must issue a blocking notice
to the Federal Central Tax Office. Once a blocking notice has been issued, it
remains in effect until revoked in writing.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >2.
To the extent that the Producer stores data in his or her profile on the App or
the Redrum Pro website or Redrum Pro receives data from the tax authorities, Redrum
Pro is entitled to use this data and make it available to the film projects in
which the Producer has participated and their service providers so that
payments from the participations (e.g. interest or loan repayments) can be made
to the Producers and the corresponding filings, in particular capital gains
tax, solidarity surcharge and church tax, can be made by Redrum Pro or the film
projects or their service providers.interest or loan repayments) can be made to
the Producers and the corresponding declarations, in particular capital gains
tax, solidarity surcharge and, if applicable, church tax, can be made by Redrum
Pro or the film projects or by their service providers to the offices
responsible for this. This applies in particular, but not exclusively, to the Producer's
first and last name, gender, address data, participation amount, bank details,
information on exemption orders and the Producer's tax identification number.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><b><span >7.
Limitation of liability</span></b></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >Redrum
Pro's liability for damages is subject to the following exclusions and
limitations of liability, without prejudice to the other legal requirements for
claims:</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >Redrum
Pro is liable if Redrum Pro is guilty of intent or gross negligence. Redrum Pro
is only liable for simple negligence in the event of a breach of an obligation,
the fulfillment of which is essential for the proper execution of the contract
and on the fulfillment of which the contractual partner may regularly rely
(so-called cardinal obligation). Otherwise, liability for damages of any kind,
regardless of the basis of the claim, including liability for culpa in
contrahendo, is excluded.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >If
Redrum Pro is liable for ordinary negligence under clause 1, Redrum Pro's
liability is limited to the damage that Redrum Pro could typically expect to
occur under the circumstances known at the time of the conclusion of the
contract. If an acquisition of participation or a related contract is invalid,
any claims of the Producer against Redrum Pro arising therefrom shall be
limited to the reimbursement of the consideration paid for the acquisition of
participation.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >3.
The above exclusions and limitations of liability do not apply if Redrum Pro has
given a guarantee for the quality of the goods, nor for damages which are to be
compensated according to the product liability law, nor for damages to life,
body or health.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >4.
The above exclusions and limitations of liability also apply to the benefit of Redrum
Pro's employees, agents and other third parties used by Redrum Pro for the
performance of the contract.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><b><span >8.
Termination of the user relationship</span></b></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >The
User Agreement for the Redrum Pro App and Website is concluded for an
indefinite period of time and may be terminated by Redrum Pro and the Producer
at any time with immediate effect. To terminate the User Agreement, the Producer
must send an email to service@Redrumpro.com. </span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >2.
Redrum Pro is entitled to exclude Producer from the new investment
opportunities on Redrum Pro as well as any other area, service or system
offered by Redrum Pro, or to restrict access in part or in whole, temporarily
or permanently, at any time without giving reasons.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >3.
Even in the event of termination of the user relationship by Redrum Pro and in
the event of restriction of the Producer's access, Redrum Pro grants those
Producers who hold participations on Redrum Pro the possibility to manage their
participations on Redrum Pro (viewing the participation overview, viewing
updates, depositing the necessary disbursement and tax information, updating
master data, voting in pooling votes). However, this does not include the use
of other Redrum Pro services not strictly necessary for the exercise of the
rights arising from the participations.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >4.
The right to terminate for cause remains unaffected.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >5.
Statutory rights of termination shall remain unaffected.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><b><span >9.
Risk information</span></b></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >1.
Film investments offer opportunities, but are risk investments. In the worst
case, there is a risk of losing the entire investment. Film investments are therefore
not suitable for retirement provision. However, there is no obligation to make
additional contributions. The risk can be minimized by spreading the investment
amount over several film investments and not investing everything in one media
investment, so that the risk is spread over several investments. In this way,
successful investments can offset other, less successful investments.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >2
Redrum Pro does not provide any investment advice or other advice. No
information or consulting contract is concluded. Redrum Pro is not obliged to
inform about ongoing developments of the film project.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >3.
The producer's investments are mostly subordinated loans. These are
entrepreneurial investments with equity-like characteristics. In the event of
the company's insolvency, the producers are only paid out of the insolvency
estate after all other third-party creditors.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >4.
The information about the film investment projects<a> -</a>
which are not produced by Redrum Pro itself - on the Redrum Pro app/website are
provided exclusively by the third-party investment projects. Redrum Pro does not
check the profitability of the third-party investment project.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >5.
The information about the media for investment on the Redrum Pro website is also
provided by other companies. The forecasts made by these companies are not a
guarantee of the future development of the media investment. Crowdinvesting is
therefore only suitable for Producers who can bear the risk of a total loss of
the invested capital. The decision to invest is made independently and on the
producer's own responsibility.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >6.
There is only a limited market for equity interests in media projects. The sale
of equity interests in media projects is only possible to a limited extent in
the absence of a corresponding market.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >It
is the sole responsibility of the Producer to decide whether to invest in film
projects using the Redrum Pro app/website and in which media project to invest.
The information available on the Redrum Pro app/website does not constitute an
advisory service by Redrum Pro and is not a substitute for expert advice. Redrum
Pro therefore recommends that, before investing in a media project and also
during the term of the investment, the investor obtains information, if
necessary, on the legal, economic and tax consequences of an investment. Any
investment can result in a total loss of the investment amount. The Producer should
therefore only invest funds whose possible loss he can afford.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><b><span >10.
Contract assumption</span></b></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >In
the event of (I) Redrum Pro's filing for insolvency or (II) if insolvency
proceedings are finally opened against Redrum Pro's assets or (III) if the
opening of such proceedings is rejected for lack of assets or (IV) Redrum Pro
is liquidated or (V) Redrum Pro ceases its business operations, the insolvency
administrators shall be entitled to assume the contract as they see fit.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><b><span >11.
Disbursements, repayments on the investment</span></b></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><b><span >&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >1.
The investment is paid out with profit share after exploitation in regular
installments solely from the income received by Redrum Pro. If no account
details are known or the known one no longer exists, Redrum Pro will hold the
money for the Producer for up to three (3) years.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >2.
Payouts during the investment phase are not possible. There will be a certain
secondary market for investments in the future, operated by Redrum Pro, in
which investments can be transferred from one participant to another participant
by sale.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >3.
The investment is not a participation under company law. It does not entitle
the holder to inspect books and accounts under commercial law or other
positions under company law. </span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><b><span >&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><b><span >12.
final provisions</span></b></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><b><span >&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >(1)
German law shall apply to the exclusion of the UN Convention on Contracts for
the International Sale of Goods (CISG). The place of jurisdiction for all
disputes arising from and in connection with this contract shall be Berlin, to
the extent permitted by law.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >2.
Should there be any contradictions between these GTC and other regulations
confirmed by the Producer, the other regulations shall prevail. This applies in
particular to the contracts for the acquisition of participation.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >Should
individual provisions of these General Terms and Conditions be or become void
or ineffective in whole or in part, this shall not affect the validity of the
remaining provisions. Statutory law shall take the place of any General Terms
and Conditions that are not included or are invalid (Section 306 (2) of the
German Civil Code (BGB)). In all other respects, the parties shall replace the
void or invalid provision with a valid provision that comes as close as
possible to it in economic terms, insofar as no supplementary interpretation of
the contract takes precedence or is possible.</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>

<p className="MsoNormal" ><span >Redrum
Pro reserves the right to change these terms and conditions at any time and
without giving reasons. The amended Terms and Conditions will be sent to the Producers
by e-mail at least two weeks before they come into force. If a Producer does not
object to the application of the new GTC in writing or in text form to Redrum
Pro within four weeks after receipt of the e-mail, the amended GTC will be
deemed accepted. Redrum Pro will separately inform the Producer of the significance
of this two-week period in the e-mail containing the amended terms and
conditions. The respective current GTC can be accessed under the App. If a Producer
does not agree with the amended Terms, he must stop using Redrum Pro's
services.</span></p>
