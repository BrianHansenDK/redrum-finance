<p ><span >We
are very pleased about your interest in our company. Data protection is of a
particularly high priority for the management of the Redrum Films &amp;
Entertainment GmbH. The use of the Internet pages of the Redrum Films &amp;
Entertainment GmbH is possible without any indication of personal data.
However, if a data subject wants to use special services of our enterprise via
our website, processing of personal data could become necessary. If processing
of personal data is necessary and there is no legal basis for such processing,
we will generally obtain the consent of the data subject. </span></p>

<p ><span >The
processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or
telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line with the
country-specific data protection regulations applicable to the Redrum Films
&amp; Entertainment GmbH. By means of this data protection declaration, our
enterprise would like to inform the public about the nature, scope and purpose
of the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data subjects
are informed of their rights by means of this data protection declaration. </span></p>

<p ><span >As
the controller, the Redrum Films &amp; Entertainment GmbH has implemented
numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete
protection of personal data processed through this website. However,
Internet-based data transmissions can always be vulnerable to security risks,
so that absolute protection cannot be guaranteed. For this reason, every data
subject is free to transmit personal data to us by alternative means, for
example by telephone. </span></p>

<br/><br/><h4 ><span >1. Definitions</span></h4>

<p ><span >The

is the processing of personal data in such a way that the personal data can no
longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional
information, provided that such additional information is kept separate and is
subject to technical and organizational measures to ensure that the personal
data is not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person. </span></p>

<br/><br/><h4 ><span lang="DE" >·<span >&nbsp;
</span></span><span >g) Controller or
person responsible for the processing</span></h4>


<p ><span >The

<p><span lang="DE" >Redrum Films &amp;
Entertainment GmbH <br/>
Haupstraße 26<br/>
10827 Berlin <br/>
Germany <br/>
Tel.: 0176 80008510 <br/>
E-Mail: info@redrumpro.de <br/>
Website: www.redrumpro.de </span></p>

<br/><br/><h4><span >3. Cookies</span></h4>

<p ><span >The
internet pages of Redrum Films &amp; Entertainment GmbH use cookies. Cookies
are text files that are placed and stored on a computer system via an Internet
browser. </span></p>

<p ><span >Numerous
websites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A
cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a string of
characters by which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific
Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This enables the visited
Internet pages and servers to distinguish the individual browser of the data
subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific
internet browser can be recognized and identified via the unique cookie ID. </span></p>

<p ><span >Through
the use of cookies, the Redrum Films &amp; Entertainment GmbH can provide the
users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be
possible without the cookie setting. </span></p>

<p ><span >By
means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be optimized
in the sense of the user. Cookies allow us, as already mentioned, to recognize
the users of our website. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier
for users to use our website. For example, the user of a website that uses
cookies does not have to re-enter his or her access data each time he or she
visits the website, because this is handled by the website and the cookie
stored on the user's computer system. Another example is the cookie of a
shopping cart in an online store. The online store uses a cookie to remember
the items that a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart. </span></p>

<p ><span >The
data subject can prevent the setting of cookies by our website at any time by
means of an appropriate setting of the Internet browser used and thus
permanently object to the setting of cookies. Furthermore, cookies that have
already been set can be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other
software programs. This is possible in all common Internet browsers. If the
data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used,
not all functions of our website may be fully usable. </span></p>

<br/><br/><h4 ><span >4.
collection of general data and information</span></h4>

<p ><span >The
website of the Redrum Films &amp; Entertainment GmbH collects a series of
general data and information with each call-up of the website by a data subject
or automated system. This general data and information is stored in the log
files of the server. The following data may be collected: (1) the browser types
and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3)
the website from which an accessing system accesses our website (so-called
referrer), (4) the sub-websites that are accessed via an accessing system on
our website, (5) the date and time of access to the website, (6) an Internet
protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the
accessing system, and (8) other similar data and information that serve to
avert danger in the event of attacks on our information technology systems. </span></p>

<p ><span >When
using these general data and information, the Redrum Films &amp; Entertainment
GmbH does not draw any conclusions about the data subject. Rather, this
information is needed (1) to deliver the contents of our website correctly, (2)
to optimize the contents of our website and the advertising for these, (3) to
ensure the long-term functionality of our information technology systems and
the technology of our website, and (4) to provide law enforcement authorities
with the information necessary for prosecution in the event of a cyber attack.
Therefore, the Redrum Films &amp; Entertainment GmbH analyzes anonymously
collected data and information on one hand, and on the other hand, with the aim
of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, to
ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The
anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from any personal
data submitted by a data subject. </span></p>

<br/><br/><h4 ><span >5. Registration
on our website</span></h4>

<p ><span >The
data subject has the opportunity to register on the website of the controller
by providing personal data. Which personal data is transmitted to the
controller in the process results from the respective input mask used for the
registration. The personal data entered by the data subject are collected and
stored exclusively for internal use by the controller and for its own purposes.
The controller may arrange for the data to be transferred to one or more
processors, for example a parcel service provider, who will also use the
personal data exclusively for an internal use attributable to the controller. </span></p>

<p ><span >By
registering on the website of the controller, the IP address assigned by the
Internet service provider (ISP) of the data subject, the date and the time of
registration are also stored. The storage of this data takes place against the
background that only in this way can the misuse of our services be prevented
and, if necessary, this data makes it possible to clarify crimes that have been
committed. In this respect, the storage of this data is necessary for the
protection of the data controller. As a matter of principle, this data is not
passed on to third parties unless there is a legal obligation to pass it on or
the passing on serves the purpose of criminal prosecution. </span></p>

<p ><span >The
registration of the data subject by voluntarily providing personal data serves
the purpose of the controller to offer the data subject content or services
which, due to the nature of the matter, can only be offered to registered
users. Registered persons are free to modify the personal data provided during
registration at any time or to have it completely deleted from the data stock
of the controller. </span></p>

<p ><span >The
controller shall provide any data subject at any time, upon request, with
information about what personal data is stored about the data subject.
Furthermore, the controller shall correct or delete personal data at the
request or indication of the data subject, provided that this does not conflict
with any statutory retention obligations. The entire staff of the controller
shall be available to the data subject as contact persons in this context. </span></p>

<br/><br/><h4 ><span >6. Contact
possibility via the website</span></h4>

<p ><span >Based
on statutory provisions, the website of the Redrum Films &amp; Entertainment
GmbH contains data that enable a quick electronic contact to our enterprise, as
well as direct communication with us, which also includes a general address of
the so-called electronic mail (e-mail address). If a data subject contacts the
controller by e-mail or by using a contact form, the personal data transmitted
by the data subject will be stored automatically. Such personal data
transmitted on a voluntary basis by a data subject to the controller will be
stored for the purpose of processing or contacting the data subject. No
disclosure of this personal data to third parties will take place. </span></p>

<br/><br/><h4 ><span >7. Comment
function in the blog on the website</span></h4>

<p ><span >The
Redrum Films &amp; Entertainment GmbH provides users with the possibility to
leave individual comments on individual blog contributions on a blog, which is
on the website of the controller. A blog is a portal maintained on a website,
usually publicly viewable, in which one or more persons, called bloggers or web
bloggers, can post articles or write down thoughts in so-called blogposts. The
blogposts can usually be commented on by third parties. </span></p>

<p ><span >If a
data subject leaves a comment on the blog published on this website, in
addition to the comments left by the data subject, information on the time of
comment entry and the user name (pseudonym) chosen by the data subject will be
stored and published. Furthermore, the IP address assigned by the Internet
service provider (ISP) of the person concerned is also logged. This storage of
the IP address is done for security reasons and in case the data subject
violates the rights of third parties by posting a comment or posts illegal
content. The storage of this personal data is therefore in the controller's own
interest, so that the controller could exculpate itself if necessary in the
event of an infringement. There is no disclosure of this collected personal
data to third parties, unless such disclosure is required by law or serves the
legal defense of the controller. </span></p>

<br/><br/><h4 ><span >8. Subscription
to comments on the blog on the website.</span></h4>

<p ><span >The
comments made in the blog of Redrum Films &amp; Entertainment GmbH can
generally be subscribed to by third parties. In particular, it is possible for
a commentator to subscribe to the comments following his comment on a
particular blog post. </span></p>

<p ><span >If a
data subject chooses the option to subscribe to comments, the controller sends
an automatic confirmation e-mail to verify in the double opt-in procedure
whether the owner of the specified e-mail address has really chosen this
option. The option to subscribe to comments can be terminated at any time. </span></p>

<br/><br/><h4 ><span >9. Routine
deletion and blocking of personal data</span></h4>

<p ><span >The
controller shall process and store personal data of the data subject only for
the period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage or where provided for by
the European Directive and Regulation or other legislator in laws or
regulations to which the controller is subject. </span></p>

<p ><span >If
the purpose of storage no longer applies or if a storage period prescribed by
the European Directive and Regulation or another competent legislator expires,
the personal data will be routinely blocked or deleted in accordance with the
statutory provisions. </span></p>

<br/><br/><h4><span >10. Rights of the data subject</span></h4>

<br/><br/><h4 ><span lang="DE" >·<span >&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang="DE" >a) Right to
confirmation</span></h4>

<p ><span>Every
data subject shall have the right, granted by the European Directive and the
Regulation, to obtain confirmation from the controller as to whether personal
data concerning him or her are being processed. If a data subject wishes to
exercise this right, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the
controller. </span></p>

<br/><br/><h4><span lang="DE">·<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang="DE" >b) Right to

<p><span>Any
person concerned by the processing of personal data has the right granted by
the European Directive and Regulation to obtain at any time from the

      possible, the planned duration for which the personal data will be stored
      or, if this is not possible, the criteria for determining this duration</span></li>
  <li className="MsoNormal"><span>the
      existence of a right to obtain the rectification or erasure of personal
      data concerning him or her, or the restriction of processing by the
      controller, or a right to object to such processing</span></li>
  <li className="MsoNormal"><span>the
      existence of a right of appeal to a supervisory authority</span></li>

      intended effects of such processing for the data subject</span></li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p><span >Furthermore,
the data subject shall have the right to obtain information as to whether
personal data have been transferred to a third country or to an international
organization. If this is the case, the data subject also has the right to
obtain information about the appropriate safeguards in connection with the
transfer. </span></p>

<p><span>If a
data subject wishes to exercise this right of access, he or she may, at any
time, contact any employee of the controller. </span></p>

<br/><br/><h4><span lang="DE">·<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang="DE">c) Right to
rectification</span></h4>

<p><span>Any
person affected by the processing of personal data has the right granted by the
European Directive and Regulation to request the immediate rectification of
inaccurate personal data concerning him or her. Furthermore, the data subject
has the right to request the completion of incomplete personal data - also by
means of a supplementary declaration - taking into account the purposes of the
processing. </span></p>

<p><span >If
a data subject wishes to exercise this right to rectify, he or she may, at any
time, contact any employee of the controller. </span></p>

<br/><br/><h4><span>·<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>d) Right to erasure
(right to be forgotten)</span></h4>

<p><span>Any
person concerned by the processing of personal data has the right, granted by
the European Directive and Regulation, to obtain from the controller the
erasure without delay of personal data concerning him or her, where one of the
following reasons applies and insofar as the processing is not necessary: </span></p>

<ul>
 <ul>
  <li className="MsoNormal"><span>The
      personal data were collected or otherwise processed for purposes for
      which they are no longer necessary.</span></li>
  <li className="MsoNormal"><span>The
      data subject revokes the consent on which the processing was based
      pursuant to Art. 6(1)(a) DS-GVO or Art. 9(2)(a) DS-GVO and there is no
      other legal basis for the processing.</span></li>
  <li className="MsoNormal"><span>The
      data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the
      GDPR and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing,
      or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2)
      of the GDPR.</span></li>
  <li className="MsoNormal"><span>The
      personal data have been processed unlawfully.</span></li>
  <li className="MsoNormal"><span>The
      deletion of the personal data is necessary for compliance with a legal
      obligation under Union or Member State law to which the controller is
      subject.</span></li>
  <li className="MsoNormal"><span>The
      personal data was collected in relation to information society services
      offered pursuant to Art. 8 (1) DS-GVO.</span></li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p><span>If
one of the aforementioned reasons applies, and a data subject wishes to arrange
for the deletion of personal data stored by the Redrum Films &amp;
Entertainment GmbH, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the
controller. The employee of the Redrum Films &amp; Entertainment GmbH will
arrange for the erasure request to be complied with immediately. </span></p>

<p><span>If
the personal data was made public by the Redrum Films &amp; Entertainment GmbH
and our company as the responsible party is obliged to delete the personal data
pursuant to Art. 17 Para. 1 DS-GVO, Redrum Films &amp; Entertainment GmbH shall
implement reasonable measures, including technical measures, to compensate
other data controllers for processing the personal data published, taking into
account the available technology and the cost of implementation, in order to
inform the data subject that he or she has requested from those other data
controllers to erase all links to the personal data or copies or replications
of the personal data, unless the processing is necessary. The employee of the
Redrum Films &amp; Entertainment GmbH will arrange the necessary in individual
cases. </span></p>

<br/><br/><h4><span>·<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>e) Right to
restriction of processing</span></h4>

<p><span>Any
person concerned by the processing of personal data has the right, granted by
the European Directive and Regulation, to obtain from the controller the
restriction of processing if one of the following conditions is met: </span></p>

<ul>
 <ul>
  <li className="MsoNormal"><span>The
      accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject for a
      period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal
      data.</span></li>
  <li className="MsoNormal"><span >The
      processing is unlawful, the data subject objects to the erasure of the
      personal data and requests instead the restriction of the use of the
      personal data.</span></li>
  <li className="MsoNormal"><span>The
      controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of
      processing, but the data subject needs it for the assertion, exercise or
      defense of legal claims.</span></li>
  <li className="MsoNormal"><span>The
      data subject has objected to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of
      the GDPR and it is not yet clear whether the legitimate grounds of the
      controller override those of the data subject.</span></li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p><span>If
one of the aforementioned conditions is met, and a data subject wishes to request
the restriction of personal data stored by the Redrum Films &amp; Entertainment
GmbH, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller. The
employee of the Redrum Films &amp; Entertainment GmbH will arrange the
restriction of the processing. </span></p>

<br/><br/><h4><span lang="DE">·<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang="DE">f) Right to
data portability</span></h4>

<p><span>Any
person concerned by the processing of personal data has the right, granted by
the European Directive and Regulation, to receive the personal data concerning
him or her, which have been provided by the data subject to a controller, in a
structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. He or she also has the
right to transmit this data to another controller without hindrance from the
controller to whom the personal data have been provided, provided that the
processing is based on consent pursuant to Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR or
Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR or on a contract pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) of the
GDPR and the processing is carried out by automated means, unless the
processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public
interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. </span></p>

<p><span>Furthermore,
when exercising his or her right to data portability pursuant to Article 20(1)
of the GDPR, the data subject shall have the right to obtain that the personal
data be transferred directly from one controller to another controller, to the
extent that this is technically feasible and provided that this does not
adversely affect the rights and freedoms of other individuals. </span></p>

<p><span>In
order to assert the right to data portability, the data subject may at any time
contact any employee of the Redrum Films &amp; Entertainment GmbH. </span></p>

<br/><br/><h4><span lang="DE">·<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang="DE">g) Right of
objection</span></h4>

<p><span>Any
person affected by the processing of personal data has the right granted by the
European Directive and Regulation to object at any time, on grounds relating to
his or her particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning
him or her carried out on the basis of Article 6(1)(e) or (f) of the GDPR. This
also applies to profiling based on these provisions. </span></p>

<p><span >The
Redrum Films &amp; Entertainment GmbH shall no longer process the personal data
in the event of the objection, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate
grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of
the data subject, or for the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims. </span></p>

<p><span >If
the Redrum Films &amp; Entertainment GmbH processes personal data for direct
marketing purposes, the data subject shall have the right to object at any time
to processing of personal data processed for such marketing. This also applies
to profiling, insofar as it is related to such direct marketing. If the data
subject objects to the Redrum Films &amp; Entertainment GmbH to the processing
for direct marketing purposes, the Redrum Films &amp; Entertainment GmbH will
no longer process the personal data for these purposes. </span></p>

<p><span>In
addition, the data subject has the right, on grounds relating to his or her
particular situation, to object to processing of personal data concerning him
or her which is carried out by the Redrum Films &amp; Entertainment GmbH for
scientific or historical research purposes, or for statistical purposes
pursuant to Article 89(1) of the Data Protection Regulation, unless such
processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public
interest. </span></p>

<p><span>In
order to exercise the right to object, the data subject may directly contact
any employee of the Redrum Films &amp; Entertainment GmbH or another employee.
The data subject is also free to exercise his/her right to object in connection
with the use of information society services, notwithstanding Directive
2002/58/EC, by means of automated procedures using technical specifications. </span></p>

<br/><br/><h4><span>·<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>h) Automated
decisions in individual cases including profiling</span></h4>

<p><span >Any
data subject concerned by the processing of personal data shall have the right,
granted by the European Directive and the Regulation, not to be subject to a
decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which
produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects
him or her, unless the decision (1) is necessary for entering into, or the
performance of, a contract between the data subject and the controller, or (2)
is permitted by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject
and that law contains suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights
and freedoms and legitimate interests, or (3) is based on the data subject's
explicit consent. </span></p>

<p><span>If
the decision (1) is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a
contract between the data subject and the data controller, or (2) it is made
with the data subject's explicit consent, the Redrum Films &amp; Entertainment
GmbH shall implement suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights
and freedoms and legitimate interests, which include at least the right to
obtain the data subject's involvement on the part of the controller, to express
his or her point of view and contest the decision. </span></p>

<p><span>If
the data subject wishes to exercise the rights concerning automated decisions,
he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller. </span></p>

<br/><br/><h4><span>·<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>i) Right to revoke
consent under data protection law</span></h4>

<p><span>Any
person affected by the processing of personal data has the right granted by the
European Directive and Regulation to withdraw consent to the processing of
personal data at any time. </span></p>

<p><span>If
the data subject wishes to exercise the right to withdraw the consent, he or
she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller. </span></p>

<br/><br/><h4><span>11. data protection during
applications and the application process</span></h4>

<p><span>The
controller collects and processes the personal data of applicants for the
purpose of handling the application procedure. The processing may also take
place electronically. This is the case, in particular, when an applicant
submits relevant application documents to the controller by electronic means,
for example, by e-mail or via a web form located on the website. If the
controller concludes an employment contract with an applicant, the transmitted
data will be stored for the purpose of processing the employment relationship
in compliance with the statutory provisions. If the controller does not
conclude an employment contract with the applicant, the application documents
will be automatically deleted two months after notification of the rejection
decision, provided that no other legitimate interests of the controller
conflict with such deletion. Other legitimate interest in this sense is, for
example, a duty to provide evidence in proceedings under the General Equal
Treatment Act (AGG). </span></p>

<br/><br/><h4><span>12. privacy policy on the use
and application of Facebook</span></h4>

<p><span>The
controller has integrated components of the company Facebook on this website.
Facebook is a social network. </span></p>

<p><span>A
social network is a social meeting place operated on the Internet, an online
community that generally enables users to communicate and interact with each
other in virtual space. A social network can serve as a platform for sharing
opinions and experiences or enables the Internet community to provide personal
or company-related information. Facebook allows users of the social network to
create private profiles, upload photos and network via friend requests, among
other things. </span></p>

<p><span>The
operating company of Facebook is Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA
94025, USA. If a data subject lives outside the USA or Canada, the controller
of personal data is Facebook Ireland Ltd, 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal
Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland. </span></p>

<p><span>By
each call of one of the individual pages of this website, which is operated by
the controller and on which a Facebook component (Facebook plug-in) has been
integrated, the internet browser on the information technology system of the
data subject is automatically caused by the respective Facebook component to
download a representation of the corresponding Facebook component from
Facebook. A complete overview of all Facebook plug-ins can be found at
https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/?locale=de_DE. Within the scope of
this technical procedure, Facebook receives knowledge of which specific subpage
of our website is visited by the data subject. </span></p>

<p><span>If
the data subject is logged in to Facebook at the same time, Facebook recognizes
which specific subpage of our website the data subject is visiting each time
the data subject calls up our website and for the entire duration of the
respective stay on our website. This information is collected by the Facebook
component and assigned by Facebook to the respective Facebook account of the
data subject. If the data subject activates one of the Facebook buttons
integrated on our website, for example the "Like" button, or if the
data subject makes a comment, Facebook assigns this information to the personal
Facebook user account of the data subject and stores this personal data. </span></p>

<p><span>Facebook
always receives information via the Facebook component that the data subject
has visited our website if the data subject is logged into Facebook at the same
time as calling up our website; this takes place regardless of whether the data
subject clicks on the Facebook component or not. If the data subject does not
want this information to be transmitted to Facebook, he or she can prevent the
transmission by logging out of his or her Facebook account before accessing our
website. </span></p>

<p><span>The
data policy published by Facebook, which is available at
https://de-de.facebook.com/about/privacy/, provides information about the
collection, processing and use of personal data by Facebook. It also explains
which setting options Facebook offers to protect the privacy of the data
subject. In addition, various applications are available that make it possible
to suppress data transmission to Facebook. Such applications can be used by the
data subject to suppress data transmission to Facebook. </span></p>

<br/><br/><h4><span>13. Privacy policy on the use
and application of Google Analytics (with anonymization function)</span></h4>

<p><span >The
controller has integrated the Google Analytics component (with anonymization
function) on this website. Google Analytics is a web analysis service. Web
analysis is the collection, compilation and analysis of data about the behavior
of visitors to websites. A web analysis service collects, among other things,
data on which website a data subject came to a website from (so-called
referrers), which subpages of the website were accessed or how often and for
how long a subpage was viewed. A web analysis is predominantly used for the
optimization of a website and for the cost-benefit analysis of internet
advertising. </span></p>

<p><span>The
operating company of the Google Analytics component is Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre
Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA. </span></p>

<p><span >The
controller uses the addition "_gat._anonymizeIp" for web analysis via
Google Analytics. By means of this addition, the IP address of the Internet
connection of the data subject is shortened and anonymized by Google if access
to our Internet pages takes place from a member state of the European Union or
from another state party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. </span></p>

<p><span>The
purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze the flow of visitors to
our website. Google uses the data and information obtained, among other things,
to evaluate the use of our website, to compile online reports for us showing
the activities on our website, and to provide other services related to the use
of our website. </span></p>

<p><span >Google
Analytics sets a cookie on the information technology system of the data
subject. What cookies are has already been explained above. By setting the
cookie, Google is enabled to analyze the use of our website. By each call of
one of the individual pages of this website, which is operated by the
controller and on which a Google Analytics component has been integrated, the
internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject is
automatically caused by the respective Google Analytics component to transmit
data to Google for the purpose of online analysis. As part of this technical
process, Google obtains knowledge of personal data, such as the IP address of
the data subject, which Google uses, among other things, to track the origin of
visitors and clicks and subsequently enable commission calculations. </span></p>

<p><span>By
means of the cookie, personal information, for example the access time, the
location from which an access originated and the frequency of visits to our
website by the data subject, is stored. Each time the data subject visits our
website, this personal data, including the IP address of the internet
connection used by the data subject, is transmitted to Google in the United
States of America. This personal data is stored by Google in the United States
of America. Google may pass on this personal data collected via the technical
procedure to third parties. </span></p>

<p><span>The
data subject can prevent the setting of cookies by our website, as already
described above, at any time by means of an appropriate setting of the Internet
browser used and thus permanently object to the setting of cookies. Such a
setting of the Internet browser used would also prevent Google from setting a
cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. In addition, a
cookie already set by Google Analytics can be deleted at any time via the
internet browser or other software programs. </span></p>

<p><span>Furthermore,
the data subject has the option to object to the collection of data generated
by Google Analytics and related to the use of this website as well as to the
processing of this data by Google and to prevent such processing. For this
purpose, the data subject must download and install a browser add-on under the
link https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. This browser add-on informs
Google Analytics via JavaScript that no data and information regarding visits
to Internet pages may be transmitted to Google Analytics. The installation of
the browser add-on is considered by Google as an objection. If the data
subject's information technology system is deleted, formatted or reinstalled at
a later point in time, the data subject must reinstall the browser add-on in
order to deactivate Google Analytics. If the browser add-on is uninstalled or
deactivated by the data subject or another person within the data subject's
sphere of control, it is possible to reinstall or reactivate the browser
add-on. </span></p>

<p><span>Further
information and the applicable data protection provisions of Google can be
found at https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/ and at
http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html. Google Analytics is explained in
more detail under this link https://www.google.com/intl/de_de/analytics/. </span></p>

<br/><br/><h4><span>14.
Privacy policy on the use and application of Google+</span></h4>

<p><span>The
controller has integrated the Google+ button as a component on this website.
Google+ is a so-called social network. A social network is a social meeting
place operated on the Internet, an online community that generally allows users
to communicate with each other and interact in virtual space. A social network
can serve as a platform for sharing opinions and experiences or enables the
Internet community to provide personal or company-related information. Google+
allows users of the social network to create private profiles, upload photos
and network via friend requests, among other things. </span></p>

<p><span>The
operating company of Google+ is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain
View, CA 94043-1351, USA. </span></p>

<p><span>By
each call of one of the individual pages of this website, which is operated by
the controller and on which a Google+ button has been integrated, the internet
browser on the information technology system of the data subject is
automatically caused by the respective Google+ button to download a
representation of the corresponding Google+ button from Google. As part of this
technical procedure, Google receives knowledge of which specific subpage of our
website is visited by the data subject. More detailed information on Google+ is
available at https://developers.google.com/+/. </span></p>

<p><span>If
the data subject is logged in to Google+ at the same time, Google recognizes
which specific subpage of our website the data subject is visiting each time
the data subject calls up our website and for the entire duration of the
respective stay on our website. This information is collected by the Google+
button and assigned by Google to the respective Google+ account of the data
subject. </span></p>

<p><span>If
the data subject activates one of the Google+ buttons integrated on our website
and thus makes a Google+1 recommendation, Google will associate this
information with the data subject's personal Google+ user account and store
this personal data. Google stores the Google+1 recommendation of the data
subject and makes it publicly available in accordance with the terms and
conditions accepted by the data subject in this regard. A Google+1
recommendation made by the data subject on this website will subsequently be
stored and processed together with other personal data, such as the name of the
Google+1 account used by the data subject and the photo stored in this account,
in other Google services, for example the search engine results of the Google
search engine, the Google account of the data subject or in other places, for
example on websites or in connection with advertisements. Furthermore, Google
is able to link the visit to this website with other personal data stored by
Google. Google further records this personal information with the purpose of
improving or optimizing Google's various services. </span></p>

<p><span>Google
always receives information via the Google+ button that the data subject has
visited our website if the data subject is simultaneously logged into Google+
at the time of calling up our website; this takes place regardless of whether
the data subject clicks the Google+ button or not. </span></p>

<p><span>If
the data subject does not want personal data to be transmitted to Google, he or
she can prevent such transmission by logging out of his or her Google+ account
before accessing our website. </span></p>

<p><span>Further
information and the applicable Google privacy policy can be found at
https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/. Further guidance from Google
on the Google+1 button can be found at
https://developers.google.com/+/web/buttons-policy. </span></p>

<br/><br/><h4><span>15.
Privacy policy on the use and application of Twitter</span></h4>

<p><span>The
controller has integrated components of Twitter on this website. Twitter is a
multilingual publicly accessible microblogging service on which users can
publish and distribute so-called tweets, i.e. short messages limited to 280
characters. These short messages can be accessed by anyone, including people
who are not registered with Twitter. However, the tweets are also displayed to
the so-called followers of the respective user. Followers are other Twitter
users who follow the tweets of a user. Twitter also enables a broad audience to
be reached via hashtags, links and retweets. </span></p>

<p><span>The
operating company of Twitter is Twitter, Inc., 1355 Market Street, Suite 900,
San Francisco, CA 94103, USA. </span></p>

<p><span>Each
time one of the individual pages of this website operated by the controller is
called up and on which a Twitter component (Twitter button) has been
integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the
data subject is automatically caused by the respective Twitter component to
download a representation of the corresponding Twitter component from Twitter.
Further information on the Twitter buttons can be found at
https://about.twitter.com/de/resources/buttons. Within the scope of this
technical procedure, Twitter receives knowledge of which specific sub-page of
our website is visited by the data subject. The purpose of integrating the
Twitter component is to enable our users to disseminate the content of this
website, to make this website known in the digital world and to increase our
visitor numbers. </span></p>

<p><span>If
the data subject is logged in to Twitter at the same time, Twitter recognizes
which specific subpage of our website the data subject is visiting each time
the data subject calls up our website and for the entire duration of the
respective stay on our website. This information is collected by the Twitter
component and assigned by Twitter to the respective Twitter account of the data
subject. If the data subject activates one of the Twitter buttons integrated on
our website, the data and information thus transmitted will be assigned to the
personal Twitter user account of the data subject and stored and processed by
Twitter. </span></p>

<p><span>Twitter
always receives information via the Twitter component that the data subject has
visited our website if the data subject is logged into Twitter at the same time
as calling up our website; this takes place regardless of whether the data
subject clicks on the Twitter component or not. If the data subject does not
want this information to be transmitted to Twitter, he or she can prevent the
transmission by logging out of his or her Twitter account before accessing our
website. </span></p>

<p><span>Twitter's
applicable privacy policy is available at https://twitter.com/privacy?lang=de. </span></p>

<br/><br/><h4><span>16.
Privacy policy on the use and application of YouTube</span></h4>

<p><span>The
controller has integrated YouTube components on this website. YouTube is an
Internet video portal that allows video publishers to post video clips free of
charge and other users to view, rate and comment on them, also free of charge.
YouTube allows the publication of all types of videos, which is why complete
film and television programs, but also music videos, trailers or videos made by
users themselves can be accessed via the Internet portal. </span></p>

<p><span>The
operating company of YouTube is YouTube, LLC, 901 Cherry Ave, San Bruno, CA
94066, USA. YouTube, LLC is a subsidiary of Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre
Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA. </span></p>

<p><span>By
each call of one of the individual pages of this website, which is operated by
the controller and on which a YouTube component (YouTube video) has been
integrated, the internet browser on the information technology system of the
data subject is automatically caused by the respective YouTube component to
download a representation of the corresponding YouTube component from YouTube.
Further information on YouTube can be found at
https://www.youtube.com/yt/about/de/. Within the scope of this technical
procedure, YouTube and Google receive knowledge of which specific subpage of
our website is visited by the data subject. </span></p>

<p ><span >If
the data subject is logged into YouTube at the same time, YouTube recognizes
which specific sub-page of our website the data subject is visiting when a
sub-page containing a YouTube video is called up. This information is collected
by YouTube and Google and assigned to the respective YouTube account of the
data subject. </span></p>

<p><span>YouTube
and Google always receive information via the YouTube component that the data
subject has visited our website if the data subject is logged into YouTube at
the same time as calling up our website; this takes place regardless of whether
the data subject clicks on a YouTube video or not. If the data subject does not
want this information to be transmitted to YouTube and Google, he or she can
prevent the transmission by logging out of his or her YouTube account before
accessing our website. </span></p>

<p><span>The
privacy policy published by YouTube, which is available at
https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/, provides information about the
collection, processing and use of personal data by YouTube and Google.</span></p>
<br/><br/>

<h4><span>17. Email advertising with newsletter registration</span>
</h4><br/>

<p>
If you register for our newsletter, we use the data required for this purpose
or separately provided by you to regularly send you our e-mail newsletter based
on your consent pursuant to Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. a DSGVO. Unsubscribing from
the newsletter is possible at any time and can be
done
either by sending a message to the contact option described above or via a <br/>
link provided for
this purpose
in the newsletter. After unsubscribing, we will delete your email address
unless you have expressly consented to further use of your data or we reserve
the right to use data beyond this, which is permitted by law and about which we
inform you in this statement." </p>

<br/><br/><h4><span>18.
Legal basis of the processing</span></h4>

<p><span>Article
6 I lit. a DS-GVO serves our company as the legal basis for processing
operations in which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the
processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to
which the data subject is a party, as is the case, for example, with processing
operations that are necessary for the delivery of goods or the provision of
another service or consideration, the processing is based on Article 6 I lit. b
DS-GVO. The same applies to such processing operations that are necessary for
the implementation of pre-contractual measures, for example in cases of
inquiries about our products or services. If our company is subject to a legal
obligation by which a processing of personal data becomes necessary, such as
for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6 I
lit. c DS-GVO. In rare cases, the processing of personal data might become
necessary to protect vital interests of the data subject or another natural
person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were to be injured on
our premises and as a result his or her name, age, health insurance data or
other vital information had to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other
third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6 I lit. d DS-GVO.
Finally, processing operations could be based on Art. 6 I lit. f DS-GVO.
Processing operations that are not covered by any of the aforementioned legal
bases are based on this legal basis if the processing is necessary to protect a
legitimate interest of our company or a third party, provided that the
interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject are not
overridden. Such processing operations are permitted to us in particular
because they were specifically mentioned by the European legislator. In this
respect, it took the view that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the
data subject is a customer of the controller (recital 47 sentence 2 DS-GVO). </span></p>

<br/><br/><h4><span>19.
legitimate interests in the processing pursued by the controller or a third
party</span></h4>

<p><span>If
the processing of personal data is based on Article 6 I lit. f DS-GVO, our
legitimate interest is the performance of our business activities for the
benefit of the well-being of all our employees and our shareholders. </span></p>

<br/><br/><h4><span>20.
duration for which the personal data are stored</span></h4>

<p><span>The
criterion for the duration of storage of personal data is the respective
statutory retention period. After expiry of the period, the corresponding data
is routinely deleted, provided that it is no longer required for the
fulfillment or initiation of the contract. </span></p>

<br/><br/><h4><span>21.
legal or contractual requirements to provide the personal data; necessity for
the conclusion of the contract; obligation of the data subject to provide the
personal data; possible consequences of non-provision</span></h4>

<p ><span>We
would like to inform you that the provision of personal data is partly required
by law (e.g. tax regulations) or may also result from contractual regulations
(e.g. information on the contractual partner). Sometimes, in order to conclude
a contract, it may be necessary for a data subject to provide us with personal
data that must subsequently be processed by us. For example, the data subject
is obliged to provide us with personal data if our company concludes a contract
with him or her. Failure to provide the personal data would mean that the
contract with the data subject could not be concluded. Before providing
personal data by the data subject, the data subject must contact one of our
employees. Our employee will explain to the data subject on a case-by-case
basis whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract
or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an
obligation to provide the personal data, and what the consequences of not providing
the personal data would be. </span></p>

<br/><br/><h4><span>22.
existence of automated decision making</span></h4>

<p><span>As a
responsible company, we do not use automatic decision-making or profiling. </span></p>
